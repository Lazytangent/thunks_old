# Redux with Thunk and Fetching Objectives

* Attach middleware to the Redux store
* Debug using the Redux logger
* Evaluate when it is appropriate to use Thunk
* Define a `fetch` request to an API
* Write a thunk action creator to make an asynchronous request to an API and
    dispatch another action when the response is received.
* Refactor an async call in a React component to use Redux with Thunk.
