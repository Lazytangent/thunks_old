## The WWWWW&H for Thunks

### Who?

- **Who** uses thunks?

  - You!

### What?

- **What** is a thunk?

  - Besides being a fun way to make your English teacher super mad, a thunk is..

    > A subroutine used to inject an additional calculation into another subroutine. Thunks are primarily used to delay a calculation until its result is needed, or to insert operations at the beginning or end of the other subroutine.

  - In non-brain-melting terms...

    > A subprocess that runs and either waits to give its result when it's good and ready, or a subprocess that inserts itself into an already established process.

  - In terms of Redux...

    > A way for us to inject an async process into the Redux flow so it can eventually update our Redux store.

  - An article recommended by the people who brought us the `redux-thunk`
      package: https://daveceddia.com/what-is-a-thunk/

  - To read more on the `redux-thunk` middleware, see their repo: https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk

### When

- **When** should I use a thunk?

  - The usual case is going to be when you need to make a fetch to some API, be it your own backend, or some 3rd party. Remember Express?? We're about to add all that knowledge back in!

### Where

- **Where** does a thunk occur in the Redux flow?

  - Great question! Let's take a look at the old flow.
    ![redux](./redux.gif)

    1. The user has an `interaction` with our Application
    2. That `interaction` sends an `action`, which as a `type` and `payload`, to the `Dispatcher`
    3. The `Dispatcher` sends an `action` to the `Reducer`
    4. The `Reducer` takes in the current `state` and `action`. It looks at all of its switch cases to see if the `action`'s `type` has a match.
        - If a match is found, the `Reducer` runs the case with the `action`'s `payload` and/or current `state`
        - If not, it's best practice to return the current `state`

    - So where do thunks come in?
        ![redux with thunk](./redux-thunk.gif)

        1. The user has an `interaction` with our Application
        2. That `interaction` sends a `Thunk`, which is a function (more on this in a bit), to the `Dispatcher`.

        3. **The `Thunk Middleware` realizes that this is a function and NOT an action. It will then run the function, and when it's good and ready, it will dispatch an actual `action.` (POJO)**

        4. The `Dispatcher` sends an `action` to the `Reducer`
        5. The `Reducer` takes in the current `state` and `action`. It looks at all of its switch cases to see if the `action`'s `type` has a match.
            - If a match is found, the `Reducer` runs the case with the `action`'s `payload` and/or current `state`
            - If not, it's best practice to return the current `state`

### WHY???

- **WHY?????**

  - It just seems like we're adding an extra step into something that's already complex. Can't I just make my fetch calls in my component and then when that call is done, update my Redux store?

    ***

    > While it's possible to make these API calls from your components and dispatch synchronously on success, for consistency and reusability it's preferable to have the source of every change to our application state be an action creator. Thunks are a new kind of action creator that will allow you to do that.

    ***

    > In React / Redux, thunks enable us to avoid directly causing side effects in our actions, action creators, or components. Instead, anything impure will be wrapped in a thunk. Later, that thunk will be invoked by middleware to actually cause the effect. By transferring our side effects to running at a single point of the Redux loop (at the middleware level), the rest of our app stays relatively pure. Pure functions and components are easier to reason about, test, maintain, extend, and reuse.

### HOW

- **HOW?**
    Let's DO THIS! Let's take a look at the App first, just to see what it does, and so on and so forth.

    1. Let's install the `redux-thunk` middleware.

        - It _basically_ looks like this.

            ```js
            const thunk = ({ dispatch, getState }) => (next) => (action) => {
                if (typeof action === 'function') {
                    return action(dispatch, getState);
                }
                return next(action);
            };
            ```

    2. Let's import `redux-thunk` into our store
    3. Now we need to add this middleware to our `applyMiddleware()`
    4. Let's go to `store/card.js` and let's look at the structure of a `ThunkCreator`.
    5. Head on over to App.js and let's change the import from the `ActionCreator` to the `ThunkCreator`.
    6. This means that we'll have to remove it from our dispatch.
    7. Let's move all update logic to the ThunkCreator
    8. Let's test it. Did it break?
    9. Let's write the `ThunkCreator` with `fetch`.

        - A `ThunkCreator` is a function that intakes the params used at invocation. It then returns another function that intakes `dispatch`. It should eventually dispatch an action (POJO).

            ```js
            const Thunk = (param1, param2) => async (dispatch) => {
                const res = await fetch('api/something');
                const { thing } = await res.json();
                dispatch(definedAction(thing));
            };
            ```
